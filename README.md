My code from the computer science courses I have taken. 

## Courses
#### 1. Introduction to Python (CS0)
Taken in August 2018, this course introduces the fundamentals of computer science using theoretical and project-based learning. Hands-on computing exercises and group exercises in Python are utilized to stress the importance of algorithms and problem solving. The course was taught by a Google in Residence, Gabe Leonard.

**Grade Received:** A

#### 2. Introdution to C++ (CSII)
Taken in January 2019, this course exposes students to computer programming using C++. The lectures are reinforced in the laboratory, where students focus on using object-oriented paradigm in problem analyss, solution design, software development, and implementation. Students in this course gain an understanding of developing reusable abstract data types and program reuse. In addition, algorithmic complexity is discussed at relevant points in the course.

**Grade Received:** A
