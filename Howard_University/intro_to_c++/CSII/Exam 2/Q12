Write your assumptions
Write the code to determine if a node, called aNode, in a doubly linked list is the head. The function should return true if it is the head or false if it is not.
Name the function isHead()

Assume that the LinkedList is implemented and self->head refers to the head node, which is an address. Node input is an address as well.

bool isHead(Node node_input){
  if(node_input == self->head){
    return True;
  }else{
    return False;
  }
}
