Write the code to count the number of nodes in a doubly linked list

name your function NodeCount
*/

Assume there is one file and this is part of the LinkedList class. We can acccess the member variable head. We assume nxt is part of the Node.

int NodeCount(){
  temp = head;
  count = 0;

  while(temp != NULL){
    count += 1;
    temp = temp->nxt;
  }
  return count;
}
