/*Write your assumptions before you start to write the code
Using the struct implementation of a Singly Linked List,
create a text message node called TextNode that holds the message of the text as a string.
The TextNode should also contain what's necessary to make it a singly linked list node.*/

We assume that the singly linked list has been implemented properly and the code runs properly with the exception of the Node implementation.

struct TextNode{
  string msg = "";
  TextNode* nxt = NULL;
};
