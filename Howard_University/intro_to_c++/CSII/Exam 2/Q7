/*Write your assumptions before starting to answer the question
Using the struct implemetation of a Doubly Linked List  create a node called TextNode
TextNode should contain the text message as a string
TextNode should also contain whatever it is that makes the struct a doubly linked list node*/

/*We assume the rest of the doubly linked list is properly implemented and we just need to implement the struct TextNode.*/
