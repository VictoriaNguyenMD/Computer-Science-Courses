DESCRIPTION
This week we will be making a program that will allow users to track temperature changes over time. They should be able to add a new entry, remove an entry, edit an entry, and print the current entries.

You should a different function for each of these options. You will be graded on your use of functions.

In order to tell the program what to do, there should be a prompt that shows the user the available actions, and asks the user which one they want to do.

As last time, all inputs should be on a new line.

 

The prompt should look like this:

What should the program do?
[A]dd a reading.
[E]dit a reading.
[P]rint existing readings.
[R]emove a reading.
[Q]uit.

 

If the user is adding a reading, they should see the following message:

What was the temperature?

 

If the user is editing a reading, they should see the following messages:

Edit reading at which position?

What should the value be instead?

 

If the user is removing a reading, they should see the following message:

Remove reading at which position?

 

If the user wants to print out the values, the format should be like this:

1: 45.0
2: -32.4
3: -40.2

Note that for printing, editing, and removing, the list should start at 1, not at 0.

The program should print "Goodbye!" when the user selects to quit.

This lab will be due on 9/18/18 at 11:59 PM.

You have unlimited submissions, and you can click on the test cases once you've submitted to see what is wrong with your output.

As always, you are welcome to talk about this with your classmates, but copying their code, either by copy+paste or by writing down what they have on their screen, is grounds to fail the class. So please don't do it!
