# Overview of Jekyll
Jekyll is a framework that transforms your plain texts into static website without needing to knowing HTML/CSS/Javascript. However, if you do know programming, you can use Jekyll and implement new features. 

*Follow the steps below in order.*

**Downloading the Programs**

To use Jekyll, you need to install 2 things:
1. Ruby, a programming language Jekyll was built with.
2. RubyGems, a package manager for Ruby that allows us to use, update, install (eg. Jekyll), and maintain Ruby programs.

To install Ruby & RubyGems:
1. Search for "Terminal" or "iTerm" in the Launchpad/Searcg button on your MAC computer. Open the program.
2. Type: `ruby -v`. Press enter. You will see something like: ruby 2.3.3. You will need a ruby version 2.1.x or higher. 
3. Type: `gem -v`. Press enter. If you have gem installed, you will see something like: gem 2.5.2.

To install Jekyll:
1. In the terminal, type: `gem install jekyll bundler`. Thee RubyGems package manager "gem" installs Jekyll.
